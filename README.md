# CPSC 471 - Hypertrophy Project

## Welcome

Welcome to the Hypertrophy Project private repo for CPSC 471 this semester. 


## Pushing/Commits, Branches, Naming Conventions

When working on any features of the project, you must make a new branch based off master that follows the following naming convention: "NamesOfPeopleWorkingOnIt - FeatureName". For example: 
"Nathan - LogInSystem". 


You must push all of your commits to that branch. Please ensure your commits have descriptive messages that explain what changes were made in said commit. This is to ensure master is always a working copy.


## Pull Requests

Once you have completed your contributions to the specific feature/part of the project, please make a pull request from your branch to master. I will review the code and ensure everything functions correctly and approve the pull request.

Eventually as we get deeper into the project lifecycle, everyone can test their own/other people's code and make/accept pull requests to master.


## GitHub Commands

Please use the correct commands to push/pull to Github accordingly. Simply copy/pasting through the web browser will force GitHub to assume every line of code you wrote is a new line because you are uploading a new file instead of modifying one. This makes code reviews more difficult to assess. Please familiarize yourself with the basic terminal commands.

## Running Code

For now while our website is static (no backend code yet, only front end code), you can simply view the website and all of its features by simply cloning this repo on your computer and opening index.html will work fine. I will release information on how to run a full website with backend code shortly.
